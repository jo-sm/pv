# mlvw - WebGL molecule viewer for es6

`mlvw`  is a WebGL-based protein viewer targeting ES6. It is built from the great [`pv` library](https://github.com/biasmv/pv) originally created by Marco Biasini.

It is currently not ready for use. Do not use it.

## Usage

To use as a script, you can add the `mlvw.min.js` script to a page in your app:

```
<script type='text/javascript' src='mlvw.min.js'></script>
```

## Documentation

Currently, refer to the [`pv` documentation](https://pv.readthedocs.io).

## Acknowledgements

`mlvw` is based upon `pv`, with changes to make it more compatible with ES6 and tools like Rollup. Big thanks to Marco for building the original library.
